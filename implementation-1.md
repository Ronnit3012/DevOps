## Proposed Solution

### Introduction

India is home to over 18 million individuals who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing (HoH), yet a significant digital divide persists due to the lack of Indian Sign Language (ISL) support in mainstream communication platforms. As virtual interactions increasingly define workplace, educational, and public experiences, it becomes imperative to ensure that communication is inclusive and accessible. In the corporate world—where tools like Zoom, internal learning portals, and streaming platforms dominate daily workflows—the integration of real-time ISL translation systems can significantly enhance engagement, participation, and equity.

To address this challenge, we propose a dual-direction AI-powered translation system that converts spoken or written language into animated ISL and vice versa. This solution is deployable across various touchpoints: as a Zoom-integrated plugin, a browser-based application, and a Chrome extension overlay. Each deployment scenario is tailored to a specific use case, with a focus on accessibility, privacy, and seamless integration into existing environments.

### System Architecture

The solution comprises two core technical architectures: one for converting **text or speech to sign language animation**, and the other for translating **sign language to text or speech**. These components are designed to operate in real-time, using a modular AI pipeline with browser-native capabilities.

#### A. Text/Speech to Indian Sign Language (ISL) Animation

This pipeline converts spoken or written English/Hindi into animated ISL gestures rendered through a 3D avatar. The flow begins with input provided either via a **live audio stream** or **typed text**. For audio input, a **Speech-to-Text Engine** transcribes the speech into normalized text, cleaning up filler words, disfluencies, and punctuation. This ensures that the language structure aligns with ISL grammar norms.

An **NLP module** processes the normalized text, simplifying sentence structures and identifying key phrases. The resulting output is passed to a **Gloss Mapper**, which converts linguistic tokens into ISL glosses—a structured, symbolic representation of sign language units.

The glosses are then fed into a **Gloss-to-Motion Model** that generates pose data representing the sequence of gestures, facial expressions, and non-manual markers. This skeletal data is rendered by a **3D Avatar Engine**, producing fluid and expressive sign animations in real time, accessible within web interfaces or embedded viewers.

#### B. Sign Language to Text/Speech Translation

The reverse pipeline allows Deaf users to sign in front of a webcam and have their communication translated into written or spoken language. The system captures the video feed and applies a pose estimation algorithm—such as **MediaPipe** or **OpenPose**—to extract hand, face, and body landmarks.

A **Gesture Recognition Model**, trained on Indian Sign Language datasets, classifies the extracted pose sequences and maps them to glosses. These glosses are passed to a **Gloss-to-Text Converter**, which reconstructs grammatically coherent sentences in English or Hindi. Optionally, a **Text-to-Speech Engine** vocalizes the output, enabling bi-directional communication in real time.

This pipeline ensures that signed input is captured and relayed in ways that are accessible to hearing users, thereby bridging communication gaps in collaborative or instructional environments.

### Deployment Scenarios

To make the system adaptable across various corporate and educational contexts, we propose three deployment models: a Zoom-integrated plugin, a web-based browser app, and a Chrome extension. Each approach addresses distinct user needs and operational constraints.

#### 1. Zoom Plugin (Live Corporate Communication)

For live meetings and professional collaboration, the Zoom Plugin integrates directly with the Zoom environment using the **Zoom Apps SDK**. It captures the live audio stream of the meeting, processes it through the **Text-to-ISL pipeline**, and displays the 3D animated avatar in a floating window or side panel within the meeting UI.

This enables Deaf participants to follow spoken conversations in real time. For the reverse direction, users can sign in front of their webcam, and the plugin translates the signs into textual captions or speech via the **Sign-to-Text pipeline**, supporting active participation during discussions, presentations, or interviews.

This plugin is especially suited for HR interactions, team standups, onboarding sessions, and accessibility compliance in high-stakes communication.

#### 2. Web-Based Browser Application (Learning and Playground)

The browser application offers a flexible, bi-directional ISL platform suitable for **learning, casual conversation, and exploration**. It runs entirely in the browser and uses the **complete translation pipelines** for both directions—text/speech to sign, and sign to text/speech.

This version caters to multiple use cases:

* **Corporate learners** or HR professionals can explore ISL through structured interactions and practice modules.
* **Employees with hearing impairments** can use it as a bridge for informal communication.
* **Product designers and accessibility researchers** can use it as a playground to test sign translation flows and gather insights.

With no dependency on third-party conferencing platforms, this web app stands as an independent, high-fidelity interface for accessibility enhancement and sign language education.

#### 3. Chrome Extension (Overlay on Web Content)

The Chrome Extension provides an **overlay-based translation experience** directly on top of web content. It is designed to enhance accessibility on **corporate learning platforms** such as **Udemy, TechAcademy**, internal training portals, or **company news videos and announcements**.

Unlike the other two implementations, the Chrome Extension **does not utilize the full SDK pipeline**. Instead, it employs **lightweight in-browser processing**, capturing audio from video content and performing basic **speech-to-text conversion** locally. Based on the transcribed text, it either fetches corresponding ISL animation sequences from a predefined library or uses a lightweight motion rendering engine for simplified avatar output.

This approach emphasizes **speed, privacy, and user-side control**, making it suitable for enhancing passive content consumption like recorded webinars, video announcements, and self-paced corporate learning. Because it functions as an overlay, it requires no changes to the host platform and can be toggled on-demand by the user.

### Conclusion

This solution proposes a technically robust and socially impactful system for bi-directional Indian Sign Language translation tailored to corporate environments. Through the use of modular AI pipelines, expressive 3D avatars, and lightweight browser technologies, it brings sign language support to live meetings, learning portals, and web-based content.

By offering three distinct deployment models—**Zoom Plugin**, **Browser Application**, and **Chrome Extension**—the solution is capable of addressing varied corporate needs, from synchronous team communication to asynchronous content accessibility and ISL education.

Importantly, the system is built with scalability and privacy in mind, operating with local processing capabilities and minimal external dependencies. This positions it not only as an assistive tool but as a key enabler of inclusive digital transformation in the modern workplace.
