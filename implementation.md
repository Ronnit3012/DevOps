## Proposed Solution

### Introduction

India has over 18 million individuals who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing (HoH), yet digital communication platforms remain largely inaccessible to them due to the limited integration of Indian Sign Language (ISL). In the context of increasing virtual collaboration—particularly in corporate and educational domains—real-time translation between spoken language and ISL is no longer a feature of convenience but a necessity for inclusivity. This solution proposes a comprehensive, bi-directional translation system between English/Hindi and ISL through a modular AI-driven architecture. The goal is to facilitate seamless communication for Deaf and HoH users across multiple platforms, with a focus on practicality, adaptability, and privacy.

### System Architecture

To ensure accurate and responsive translations, our system is composed of two core AI pipelines: **Text/Speech to ISL Animation** and **Sign Language to Text/Speech**. These architectures are designed for real-time execution with support for platform integration and local processing.

#### A. Text/Speech to Indian Sign Language (ISL) Animation

This pipeline is responsible for converting spoken English or Hindi into animated ISL output in real time. It begins with input from either **live speech** or **typed text**. When speech is provided, a **Speech-to-Text Engine** (such as the Web Speech API or Whisper) transcribes it into clean, normalized text. This text is then processed through an **NLP module** to simplify sentence structure, remove unnecessary punctuation, and align it with ISL-compatible grammar.

The normalized output is passed to a **Gloss Mapper**, which translates textual content into ISL glosses—standardized symbolic representations of sign components. These glosses serve as intermediaries between linguistic structure and physical movement.

Subsequently, the glosses are transformed into a **Pose Sequence** using a **Gloss-to-Motion Model**, which generates 3D skeletal movement instructions. These movements include both **manual signs** (hand gestures) and **non-manual markers** such as facial expressions and body orientation, all of which are crucial for conveying semantic context in ISL.

Finally, a **3D Avatar Engine** renders the real-time animation using WebGL/WebGPU. The avatar mirrors the generated skeletal instructions with smooth transitions and expressive detail, allowing the viewer to comprehend the communication in natural ISL.

#### B. Sign Language to Text/Speech Translation

In the reverse pathway, the system enables users who sign in ISL to be understood by those who rely on spoken or written language. The process begins by capturing **video input from a webcam**, which is processed using **MediaPipe or OpenPose** to extract landmark coordinates for hands, arms, and face.

The key challenge here is gesture classification, handled by a **Gesture Recognition Model** trained on annotated ISL datasets. This model identifies meaningful sign patterns and maps them back to ISL glosses.

These glosses are then passed through a **Gloss-to-Text Generator**, which reorders and expands them into grammatically coherent text in English or Hindi. If speech output is required, a **Text-to-Speech (TTS) Engine** synthesizes the final audio response.

This reverse translation pipeline ensures that signed input is captured, understood, and relayed accurately in environments where text or speech is the dominant mode of communication.

### Deployment Scenarios

To meet diverse usage contexts and platform constraints, we have designed three different implementations for deploying this system:

#### 1. **Zoom Plugin (Corporate-Focused Deployment)**

In corporate environments where **Zoom** is a primary collaboration tool, we propose a Zoom Plugin built using the **Zoom Apps SDK**. This plugin captures **live audio** from the meeting stream, processes it through the **full Text-to-ISL pipeline** using the SDK, and renders the ISL animation within the Zoom interface—either as a floating window or side-by-side panel.

For reverse translation, users can sign into their webcam, and the plugin uses the **Sign-to-Text pipeline** locally to transcribe signs into text, which can be displayed as captions or spoken via TTS. This is especially useful for inclusive discussions, HR conversations, and training sessions where Deaf participants need to fully engage in the dialogue.

#### 2. **Web-Based Application (Cross-Platform Accessibility)**

The standalone **Web Application** acts as a universal access point for both Deaf and hearing users. It offers bi-directional ISL translation: converting typed or spoken content into avatar-rendered signs, and signed input (via webcam) into captions or voice.

This app runs entirely in the browser using Web APIs and leverages the **full SDK pipeline** for accurate translations. It is suitable for educational settings, government services, and personal communication, especially when lightweight deployment and cross-platform support are priorities.

#### 3. **Chrome Extension (Overlay-Based Utility)**

The **Chrome Extension** offers accessibility enhancements directly over web content—making it ideal for Deaf users consuming online learning platforms, video lectures, or reading-heavy websites. Unlike the previous two models, the Chrome Extension **does not rely on the SDK pipeline**. Instead, it uses **lightweight scripts and browser APIs** for real-time audio capture and basic speech-to-text processing.

The extension then retrieves pre-rendered sign animations from a library or uses minimal motion rendering for simplified ISL. Since it overlays content rather than deeply integrating, it trades full expressiveness for speed and convenience. However, it respects privacy by doing all processing locally in the browser and is extremely versatile in use.

### Conclusion

This multi-modal, modular approach to Indian Sign Language translation provides a robust and flexible system for real-time communication between Deaf and hearing users. The architectural pipelines handle both directions—text/speech to sign and sign to text/speech—using AI-driven models optimized for expressiveness, speed, and privacy.

By offering three tailored deployment pathways (Zoom Plugin, Web App, and Chrome Extension), the solution can meet the needs of corporate users, public platforms, and everyday browsing scenarios. Special care has been taken to ensure local processing, offline fallback mechanisms, and extensibility through SDK interfaces.

In a country like India, where ISL is not yet natively integrated into mainstream software ecosystems, this product aims to be a pioneering step toward digitally inclusive communication—empowering users to interact, collaborate, and thrive regardless of hearing ability.
